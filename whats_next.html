        <h2>Skill Leveling</h2>
            <p>Another feature that RLCraft has is a skill leveling system. Using Minecraft's XP system, the player can convert their earned XP levels into skill levels using one of the game's many GUIs. As you progress through RLCraft, you're going to need these skill levels. These levels allow you to plant new crops and use more powerful tools, weapons, and armor. Some unique skills are also unlocked through this GUI, but I'll leave you to discover those for yourself.</p>

        <h2>Dragons</h2>
            <p>Dragons are a menace and you're going to need all of your wits about you, as well as some of the best armor in the game, if you want to slay one. Tough, deadly, and agressive, the dragons that spawn through the world will most likely kill you in one hit and like to terrorize villages by burning them to the ground. While these adversaries may be hard to defeat, they yield some of the best materials in the game: Dragon bones and dragon scales. These can be used to make the most protective armor in the game, as well as some of the best weapons.</p>

        <h2>Enchantments</h2>
            <p>Using the mod Rin's So Many Enchantments, a plethora of new enchantments are added to the game. Ranging from more powerful levels of sharpness to jump boost on your armor, Rin's So Many Enchantments will help you to customize your playstyle even more.</p>

        <h2>Are you Ready?</h2>
            <p>If you feel ready to jump right into the action, then jump away! RLCraft may be dangerous, but it's also filled with plenty of places to explore and things to do, so explore away! The world is at your fingertips!</p>
